Progress:
Current state- DEBUG ONLY; pre-prototype, may contain DIRTY code and file reverse engineering work in progress with a lot of trash. 
Such DEBUG modules are designed to be rewritten into stable version, without trash, test functions and keeping in mind all future improvements.

=Are debug modules fully featured?

-Yes, they are. They are debug just to test the functions and work with reverse engineering, but they should support all functionalities.
